## Thank you for your download!

This is my custom boilerplate React App for starting new projects. I have some custom architecture which I find works for me. I have included
documentation and guidelines for using this package. There is always room for improvement, if you feel something can be improved please
submit a bug report / feature request on the gthub page. Pull requests welcome.

## Reasons to use this package:

* Webpack 4 pre-configured
* Good starting point for scalabilty of your app.
* Preset LESS mixins for easy styling.
* Basic mobile first CSS grid structure in place
* Includes linting on compile to keep your code styling standardised
* Includes useful commands
* Pre-configured routing
* Express JS pre-configured for production
* Includes markdown & HTML parsing for documentation
* Includes scalable functions for http requests

## Reasons to not use this package:
* You want something more advanced and configurable with many more options
* You want to use other CSS pre-processors
* You don't want to use React or any other packages listed in the packages section

## How to use this package:
If you are reading this, I take it you have cloned the repo and started the dev server.
If you are building an app, the first thing you will want to do is remove the files that your app doesn't need.
Remember to delete the .git directory, unless you are contributing to this project.

Unfortuantely at this stage, there is no way to update versions which will reflect in your app because
your app is continued development from here on. However, I will be updating this from time to time so that
future projects have a better starting point.
